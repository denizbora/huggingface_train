# Huggingface Train

This repository contains code and notebooks for training models using Hugging Face Transformers and other related libraries. It is designed to help you quickly set up and run training sessions for various machine learning tasks.

## Structure

- **`confusion.py`**: Script for generating confusion matrices.
- **`dataset.py`**: Helper functions for managing datasets.
- **`helper.py`**: Utility functions used across different scripts.
- **`timm_train.ipynb`**: Notebook for training models with the Timm library.
- **`transformers_train.ipynb`**: Notebook for training models using Hugging Face Transformers.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/denizbora/huggingface_train.git
   cd huggingface_train
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the notebooks or scripts to train your models.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- All necessary dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Usage

Each notebook is designed to be run independently. Load your data, configure the model, and start training. Check the comments within each script for detailed instructions.
